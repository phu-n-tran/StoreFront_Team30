# System Environment

       The design of our system environment includes the use of a Linux based machine to house our database application. This linux server will host an apache webserver that will be serving our application to the users. The database that we will use will be created and maintained by a mySQL DBMS. The front-end application will be written using React.js. The front-end will then communicate with the database using python scripts. Overall, this project will require knowledge of mySQL, Python, and React.js to arrive at completion.

# Non-functional Requirements

       Non-functional requirements include many things such as performance, scalability, security, endurance, usability, and stability. Our goal for these non-function requirements would be to hit most of these for our final product. For performance, we plan on having our website able to support a large amount of users. For scalability, we are going to try to efficiently manage how we access our database to allow for easy expansion as well as code our front-end in a way where we could easily modify one section without effecting the others. For security, we are planning on working making sure our authentication system works effectively for individual accounts. For usability, users will be able to easily and effectively navigate our website regardless of their personal circumstances. And finally for stability, our website should be able to handle a large amount of users without effecting another users experience. Overall, the website should be easy to use for both users and programmers alike as well as being able to efficiently handle large numbers of users.
